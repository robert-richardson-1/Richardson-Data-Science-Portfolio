# Basic Streamlit App

⚠️ *Disclaimer* ⚠️

- This is the first-ever app that I have made using Streamlit and Streamlit commands. Enjoy with a grain of salt!
- Code can be found in this repository location in the main.py file. Instructions on how to run app are in the comments at the beginning of the main.py file

## Description

This Streamlit app explores the "Palmer's Penguins" Dataset. Using the added filters, one can search and organize the penguins' data by the following:
- species
- island
- bill length (mm)
- bill depth (mm)
- flipper length (mm)
- body mass (g)
- sex
- year

## Additional Info
- At the bottom of the Streamlit app, there is the entire raw data set, to view all data if needed.
