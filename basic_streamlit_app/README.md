# Basic Streamlit App

⚠️ *Disclaimer* ⚠️

This is the first-ever app that I have made using Streamlit and Streamlit commands. Enjoy with a grain of salt!


## Description

This Streamlit app explores the "Palmer's Penguins" Dataset. Using the added filters, one can search and organize the penguins' data by the following:
- species
- island
- bill length (mm)
- bill depth (mm)
- flipper length (mm)
- body mass (g)
- sex
- year

## Additional Info
At the bottom of the Streamlit app, there is the entire raw data set, to view all data if needed.
